# Collagen processing background
Insoluble collagen, when purchased, comes in dehydrated powder form. In order to work with this collagen we need to rehydrate it, before it can be blended, and potentially dialysed. some information about the science behind the acetic acid rehydration goes in here for example. Links to papers, etc, can be included.

## Sample rehydration protocol

This is an example protocol for rehydrating collagen:

Rehydrating 100ml of 0.5wt% collagen:
1. Measure 500mg of collagen out and add to 100ml of 0.05M acetic acid. Do not stir or shake the mixture, the collagen will be floating on the surface.
2. Place the collagen suspension in the fridge for 72+ hours.
3. Before further processing the collagen should appear fluffy, with no hard lumps present, shown in figure ?. If lumps are present, leave collagen for longer in the fridge.
