# Collagen
Collagen is the main material used in the group. A brief overview on collagen goes in this section.

## Background
Some background on collagen goes on in here, probably a bunch of links to useful reading and papers to get people up to speed. Can be taken from a thesis or the like and have a bunch of links embedded or in a list at the end.

## Collagen preparation
Brief information on collagen preparation in the group. Overview of the way we do it, the reasoning why, and some things to potentially watch out for. Links to deeper pages where we go over the process in significantly more detail, for example [collagen preparation](/home/collagen/preparation) should be it's own link, for a page with protocols, images, and general notes and thoughts on the process.
